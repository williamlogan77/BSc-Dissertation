The project was formally titled "The production of 154 Samarium via intermediate neutron capture".

It required me to take the output from a simulation (that somebody in the department along with a team had built) of a certain type of star and understand what is going on inside of the star using different plots + understanding of numbers.

The project was primarily focused on the science side of things rather than the programming side and therefore if I could go back now and do it again, I would.

Finally, this project also demanded that I used some unix system and therefore I had to work through dual booting with linux and getting to grips with the unix system.
