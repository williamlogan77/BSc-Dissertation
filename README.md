The project was formally titled "The production of 154 Samarium via intermediate neutron capture".

It required me to take the output from a simulation (that somebody in the department along with a team had built) of a certain type of star and understand what is going on inside of the star using different plots + understanding of numbers.

The project was primarily focused on the science side of things rather than the programming side and therefore certain aspects of the codebase would need refining. The files in this repository are a snapshot of the (what feels like millions) thousands of lines of code that were written.

Finally, this project also demanded that I used some unix system and therefore I had to work through dual booting with linux and getting to grips with the unix system.
